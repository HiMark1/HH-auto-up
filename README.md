Console C# application for raising resumes in the job search service hh.ru using puppeteer.
For the program to work correctly, you need to:
1) Be previously authorized in hh.ru in the browser
2) You need to change the appsettings.json file. You need to enter your path to the browser in the BrowserPath line and your path to the user data of this browser in the UserProfilePath line
3) Set the autostart of this program in your operating system for every day.
p.s. I strongly recommend using the Google Chrome browser.
